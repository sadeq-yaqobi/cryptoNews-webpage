# cryptoNews-webpage

This is my second project aimed at practicing and improving my skills in web development. The project is a simple web application that displays the latest news and updates in the cryptocurrency market. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and fetches data from the CoinGecko API.

## Website

## About the Project

The project is designed to help me learn and practice web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also serves as an introduction to working with APIs, as I use the CoinGecko API to fetch the latest news articles.

## How to Use

To use the application, simply download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The application will fetch the latest news articles from the CoinGecko API and display them on the page. You can click on any article to read more about it.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the application.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides information about the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are new to web development, I recommend that you start by learning these languages and practicing with small projects like this one.

You will also need to sign up for a free CoinGecko API key in order to fetch the latest news articles. You can do this by visiting the [CoinGecko API website](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
